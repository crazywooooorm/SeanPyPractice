Turtle & Fish Game:
  A turtle and ten fish move in a 10 * 10 space, they have different moving speed and random moving directions. When they reach the border, they will turn around and move in a opposite direction. Turtle has limited stamina, every time it eats a fish the stamina would recover a bit. The game finishes when fish are all eaten or the turtle runs out of its stamina.
  In order to test the balance of this game, I set a simulation and tried to tune the parameters in the game. Anyway, the game is just for fun.
