### Turtle & Fish Game

- A turtle and ten fish move in a 10 * 10 space, they have different moving speed and random moving directions. When they reach the border, they will turn around and move in a opposite direction. Turtle has limited stamina, every time it eats a fish the stamina would recover a bit. The game finishes when fish are all eaten or the turtle runs out of its stamina.

- In order to test the balance of this game, I set a simulation and tried to tune the parameters in the game. Anyway, the game is just for fun.


### Pig Game

- This is a dice game. Every round you can roll a dice and decide whether to re-roll it unless you roll a one. The score of every round will be acumulated. The winner is the one who reaches 100 earlier. Now the rules are easy and the AI just follow some simple strategies. While I hope one day I can design a more complicated game and make the AI does show its advantages on calculation. 


### Stack

- The class is designed to mimic the functions of stack, and I added some tips in it to make it more cute and friendly. I have to say it is much easier to use python to design something because when I used Java to design the same Stack thing, I wrote over 100 lines of code.
